Movie Theater App

Technologies used
The app uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display the movie information and enable users to buy tickets.

How to use
To use the app, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The app will automatically display the details for the first movie in the list, and show a menu of all the movies on the left side of the page.

Clicking on a movie in the menu will update the movie details displayed on the right side of the page to reflect the selected movie.

To buy tickets, simply enter the desired number of tickets in the input field next to the "Buy Ticket" button and click the button. If there are enough tickets available, the ticket count will update and the number of available tickets will decrease. If there are not enough tickets available, an error message will be displayed.
